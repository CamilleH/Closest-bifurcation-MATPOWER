function normal = compute_normal_vector(mpc,bif_info,param_list)
% COMPUTE_NORMAL_VECTOR(MPC,BIF_INFO_PARAM_LIST) computes the NORMAL vector
% in the space of parameters defined in PARAM_LIST at the operating point 
% defined in MPC. The operating point is assumed to be either a saddle-node
% bifurcation point (SNB) or a limit-induced bifurcation point (LIB).
% Information about the bifurcation is provided in BIF_INFO.
